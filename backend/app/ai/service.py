WORLD_SETTING = """
In the year 2055, humanity stands at a crossroads. The world we once knew has been reshaped by the relentless march of climate change and technological progress. Coastal cities are threatened by frequent floods exacerbated by rising seas, their former inhabitants now unwelcome wanderers in a world grown hostile to the displaced. Europe shivers under an unprecedented deep freeze, while tropical regions are battered by near-constant storms.

The promise of artificial intelligence, once heralded as our salvation, has proven a double-edged sword. Robots and automation have revolutionized industry and daily life, but at a steep environmental cost. The pursuit of ever-more-powerful AI has accelerated climate change, even as it fails to achieve the long-sought goal of artificial general intelligence.

In this brave new world, productivity soars while birthrates plummet. An aging population finds itself increasingly obsolete, retreating into virtual realities and AI companionship. The gap between the tech-savvy elite and those left behind widens daily. Despite unprecedented technological marvels, famine and disease still plague many corners of the globe.

Humanity finds itself paralyzed, caught between complacency and fear. Some cling desperately to the familiar, while others lose themselves in digital escapes. Tensions simmer as nations close their borders to climate refugees, sparking conflicts and humanitarian crises. Yet beneath the surface, a deeper tension builds â€“ a growing realization that something must change. In this world of environmental chaos and technological wonder, a few dare to ask: can we reclaim our humanity and forge a new path forward? Or are we doomed to be swept away by the very forces we've unleashed?
